# employee-tracker

## Description 

This application was built to help business owners easily keep track of employees and their changing roles. The user can view or add departments, roles, and employees as well as update an employee's role.

## Installation

To use this application the user must open the terminal and type *npm start* into the command line. Follow prompts.

## Usage 

Once app is started and user is responding to prompts the database will be updated continuously.

To view either departments, roles, or employees the user must select them in the main menu. This is also a great way for the user to see updates via the terminal.

When the user is satisfied with their updates they may EXIT the app via the main menu's *EXIT* option.

Below is an example video of the finished application.
